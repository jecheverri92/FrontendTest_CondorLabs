# FrontendTest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.1. [Angular](https://angular.io), [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create a Serverless form-based application.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `FrontendTest_CondorLabs` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the `FrontendTest_CondorLabs` repository. You can get git from [here][git].

I also use a number of Node.js tools to initialize and test `FrontendTest_CondorLabs`. You must have Node.js
and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here][node].

### Clone `FrontendTest_CondorLabs`

Clone the `FrontendTest_CondorLabs` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/jecheverri92/FrontendTest_CondorLabs.git
cd FrontendTest_CondorLabs
```


## Development server
---------
This starterkit is based off of an [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) application. Because of this, you will need to install the CLI tool, dependences and launch this application using 

```ng serve -o```

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
ng serve -o
```

This will launch an Angular application @ [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser. You can go there to try out the default application.
